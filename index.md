## Selected projects in data science, machine learning and computer vision

### Speech to text recognition 

Developing a TensorFlow-based audio classification model using the mini Speech Commands dataset. In this, I'm training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying spoken commands, and then evaluate the model's performance.

### Interactive Image Classification Tool using VGG16

For each image uploaded, Top 5 labels for the images are displayed with their probabilities. In this project, I used VGG16 for classification which is trained on ImageNet dataset.

### Know what's in your image

Implemented an image classification project using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Defined a convolutional neural network (CNN), specified the loss function and optimizer, and trained the model on the training set.

### NLP: Sentiment Analysis on India's Foreign Affairs Minister's first Book 

I web scraped Amazon reviews, applied regex for data cleaning, and used Beautiful Soup for extracting information. Implemented lemmatization and tokenization techniques to process the text data, followed by generating a word cloud for visualization. Analyzed the plotted sentiment analysis based on the processed reviews.

### COVID data visualization

I analyzed Covid-19 policy responses using the OxCGRT study's data, visualizing the global implementation of stay-at-home recommendations from 2020 to 2022 with ggplot2. The data underwent processing to simplify scales for stay-at-home directives and income support. The resulting visualization offers insights into the extent of these measures across regions, enabling a comparative analysis of restrictions and income support implementation during the specified period.
